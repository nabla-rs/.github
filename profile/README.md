## nabla-rs

### What is nabla?
nabla is an organization focused on developing tools for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in Rust

### Why?
Rust is a maturing language, and while several libraries exist for solving ODEs, continous development and support is necessary.

### Can I join?
Absolutely! Anyone interested in the use and/or development of tools for solving ODEs in Rust are welcome to join.
For an informal meeting place, you may also join our Discord server using the following link: https://discord.gg/9wTzq4K2
